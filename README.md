# GeneXus-Jenkins Integration
This repository contains resources used for [GeneXus](https://genexus.com/) and [GeneXus Server](https://genexus.com/gxserver) integrations with a Jenkins server.

With this integration you may create, configure and monitor continuous integration pipelines in a [Jenkins server](https://www.jenkins.io/), directly from GeneXus IDE or GeneXus Server web console.

Please refer to [How To Configure GeneXus-Jenkins Integration](https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/wiki?46996) in the GeneXus Wiki for further information on how to configure Jenkins and GeneXus Server for this.
